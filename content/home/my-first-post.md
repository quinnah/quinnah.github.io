## Introduction

Hi, I'm **Quinna**. I'm currently a CS student at University of Michigan.

In past lives I've worked at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) on the Database Experience team (Rust Driver, [VSCode Extension](https://www.mongodb.com/products/vs-code)) and [Nuro.ai](https://www.nuro.ai/) on the Behavior team, learning about ML, prediction, planning, and more. 

Some of my favorite courses so far have been [Web Systems](https://eecs485.org/) and Operating Systems (currently taking). My current professional goals are to learn as much as I can about computer science (algorithms, distributed systems, programming languages, databases) and apply my skills as a software engineer in industry.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, strength training, travel, and time with friends. Feel free to poke around my blog & website for more adventures!
