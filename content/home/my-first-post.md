## Introduction

Hi, I'm **Quinna**. I'm currently a CS student at University of Michigan. I'm especially interested in AI/ML.

In past lives I've worked at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) on the developer tools team and[Nuro.ai](https://www.nuro.ai/) on the autonomy: behavior team. 

On campus, I've worked as an Instructional Aide for a human-centered software development senior capstone, organized a 1300 person [conference](https://www.tedxuofm.com/2022) and conducted research.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, NYT crosswords, strength training, travel, and time with friends. Feel free to poke around my [blog](https://quinnah.github.io/blog/) & website for more adventures!
