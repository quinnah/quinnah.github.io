## Introduction

Hi, I'm **Quinna**. I'm currently a CS student at University of Michigan.

In past lives I've worked at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) on the Database Experience team (Rust Driver, [VSCode Extension](https://www.mongodb.com/products/vs-code)) and [Nuro.ai](https://www.nuro.ai/) on the Behavior team, learning about ML, prediction, planning, and more. Currently, I'm an Instructional Aide for the University of Michigan College of Engineering, for EECS 497 (a senior human-centered software development capstone course)

Some of my favorite courses so far have been [Web Systems](https://eecs485.org/) and Operating Systems (currently taking). My current professional goals are to learn as much as I can about computer science (algorithms, distributed systems, programming languages, databases) and apply my skills as a software engineer in industry.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, strength training, travel, and time with friends. Feel free to poke around my [blog](https://quinnah.github.io/blog/) & website for more adventures!
