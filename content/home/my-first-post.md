## Introduction

Hi, I'm **Quinna**. I'm a computer science student at University of Michigan. My current goal is to apply my curiosity, problem-solving, and lifelong interest in STEM towards growing my skills as a software engineer. I'm interested in working on AI/ML, especially generative AI and robotics.

In past lives I've worked at [Nuro.ai](https://www.nuro.ai/) on the autonomy: behavior team and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) on the developer tools team (VSCode extension). This summer, I'm working as a backend + ML software engineer intern at a ðŸŒ± stage [YCombinator startup](https://www.industrialnext.ai/en) revolutionizing industrial robotics.

On campus, I've worked as an Instructional Aide for a senior capstone (Human-Centered Software), led a team of 50+ students to organize a 1300+ attendee TEDx [conference](https://www.tedxuofm.com/2022), and did research in [breast cancer stem cells](https://www.med.umich.edu/wicha-lab/index.html) as part of the Michigan Research and Discovery Scholars program.

My passions include health & wellness, education, writing, and travel. Feel free to poke around my [blog](https://quinnah.github.io/blog/) & website!
