## Introduction

Hi, I'm **Quinna**. I'm a CS student at University of Michigan and software engineer. I'm especially interested in AI/ML and its applications. My long-term vision is to work on technical challenges on systems that interface with people, ranging from search engines, recommender systems, and autonomous robotics.

In past lives I've worked at [Nuro.ai](https://www.nuro.ai/) on the autonomy: behavior team and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) on the developer tools team. This summer, I'm working as a backend/ML software engineer intern at a seed-stage [YCombinator startup](https://www.industrialnext.ai/en) revolutionizing industrial robotics.

On campus, I've worked as an Instructional Aide for a senior capstone (Human-Centered Software), led a team of 50+ students to organize a 1300+ attendee TEDx [conference](https://www.tedxuofm.com/2022), and did HCI research and cancer stem-cell research as part of the Michigan Research and Discovery Scholars program.

My passions include health & wellness, education, writing, and travel. Feel free to poke around my [blog](https://quinnah.github.io/blog/) & website!
