I'll be taking a rigorous courseload with three EECS courses this upcoming semester. The combination of the courses with recruiting will be tough, but I believe that my past semesters - from juggling a time-intensive class with a full-time internship in a different city (Winter 2022) or a full courseload with recruiting and other commitments - have prepared me well for the final battle, and this will be the ultimate test of how my time management skills, ability as a CS student, and sheer determination & grit, have improved over college. 

Here is the list of courses I am taking, my goals from each, and a tentative plan of how I hope to succeed in each of them. I expect the plans to become more concrete as I start the courses. (Iâ€™ve added recruiting because for all intents and purposes, it is at least a 3 credit course!)

## EECS 482: Operating Systems
Goals:
- [ ] Gain confidence in my ability as a programmer
- [ ] Get better at upfront design & planning (instead of jumping straight into writing code), reasoning about bugs, debugging, and concurrent programming

Checklist:
- [x] Secure a great team for projects (done) 
- [ ] Review threads and processes over break
- [ ] Review C++ from 280/281: STL, smart pointers, RAII
- [ ] Get started early on projects.
- [ ] Stay up-to-date on the lecture content (< 24 hours behind!) and optimize for understanding
- [ ] Start *seriously* studying for the midterm & final ***at least a week and a half in advance***

## EECS 376: Foundations of Computer Science (Theory)
Goals:
- [ ] Improve my understanding of the theory + math which apply to CS problems like dynamic programming, P and NP

Checklist:
- [ ] Find a good homework/study group in the first week or two
- [ ] Review Joy of Sets, basic proof-writing
- [ ] Schedule time to go to office hours, 1-2x a week

## EECS 390: Programming Paradigms
Goals:
- [ ] Gain confidence in my ability as a programmer
- [ ] Build the foundation to be able to quickly pick up a new language & apply it
- [ ] Learn (and apply) programming best practices, functional programming, etc.

Checklist:
- [ ] Start early on homework & projects

## Recruiting
(This is towards the bottom because otherwise it would disrupt the flow - but in reality it is P0, along with EECS 482.)

Goals:
- [ ] Secure a software engineering internship for Summer 2023 by end-of-March
- [ ] Keep my head & mindset straight. Go into each interview feeling prepared, confident, and seeing it as a chance to measure my progress and show how far I've come


Checklist:
- [ ] Set up a rigorous system for a) prepping for technical interviews, via Leetcode & mocks (majority of this is being frontloaded rn during break) and b) applying, doing Hackerranks, interviews.
- [ ] Keep the pipeline moving from Leetcode -> applying online -> completing OAs/Hackerranks -> interviewing. Keep multiple processes moving at once.
- [ ] For startups: source startups & email -> make these applications more targeted. (Ask Varun, Samay, Yash for advice on this)
